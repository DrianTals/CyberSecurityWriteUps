# Love at First Breach 2nd Challenge: Signed Messages

My Dearest Hacker,
LoveNote built it's reputation on trust. Every message, every action, signed and verified by the system itself. LoveNoe claims that no message can be forged, no identity faked.

Yet an internal leak suggests the platform may be trusting something it shouldn't. With Valentine's Day fast approaching, the consequences of a broken trust system could be disastrous.
