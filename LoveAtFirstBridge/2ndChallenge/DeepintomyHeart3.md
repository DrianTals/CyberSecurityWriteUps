# Love at First Breach 2nd Challenge: Deep Into my Heart

## Step 3: Breaching

My Dearest Hacker,
Cupid's Vault was designed to protect secrets meant to stay hidden forever. Unfortunately, Cupid underestimated how determined attackers can be.

Intelligence indicates that Cupid may have unintentionally left vulnerabilities in the system. With the holiday deadline approaching, you've been tasked with uncovering what's hidden inside the vault before it's too late.

You can find the web application here: http://MACHINE_IP:5000

1. Start Machine in the TryHackMe Challenge to get the IP Address.

2. Enter the IP into the website

3. You can see a page about anonymous love letters

4. Inspecting and View Page Sourcing will be pointless

5. And here you can test **"robots.txt"**
